Anomaly Detection is a critical task in computer vision with numerous real-world applications.
While traditional anomaly detection methods have achieved significant progress, the
challenge of continual learning—where models must adapt to new data while retaining previously
learned knowledge—remains underexplored. This thesis investigates Pixel-Level Anomaly
Detection in Continual Learning using the STFPM model. An in-depth analysis of the MVTec
Anomaly Detection dataset for STFPM is conducted, offering valuable insights. The performance
of STFPM is then evaluated in the continual learning scenario. Based on these results,
a more efficient architecture than STFPM, called PaSTe, is tested for the first time in the continual
learning setting. Furthermore, to reduce memory requirements, a Compressed Replay
approach is adopted. This approach minimizes the memory occupied by the replay buffer without
compromising model performance, enabling more efficient and scalable anomaly detection
in resource-constrained environments.
